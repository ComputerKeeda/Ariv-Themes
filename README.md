# Ariv Themes

Ariv Themes is a clean, modern dark theme extension for VS Code.

A free, modern dark theme alternative to Vira/Material Themes.

## Available Themes

- Ariv Dark
- Ariv Ocean

## How to Use

1. Install **Ariv Themes** from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Open Command Palette.
3. Run **Preferences: Color Theme**.
4. Select **Ariv Dark** or **Ariv Ocean**.

Once you switch to an Ariv theme, the extension automatically applies a tuned editor experience.

## What Gets Applied Automatically

When an Ariv theme is active, the extension applies:

- `editor.fontFamily` → Fira Code fallback stack
- `editor.fontLigatures` → enabled
- `editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled` → enabled
- `workbench.iconTheme` → material-icon-theme
- `workbench.productIconTheme` → feather-product-icons

> For best results, install [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) on your system.

## Settings Backup & Restore

Ariv Themes takes a backup of your existing global settings **before** applying Ariv settings.

- If you switch away from Ariv Dark/Ocean, your previous settings are restored automatically.
- Backup is then cleared, so the next time you use Ariv Themes a fresh backup is created.

## How to Remove Ariv Theme Behavior

If you no longer want automatic Ariv configuration:

1. Switch to any non-Ariv theme (this restores your previous settings).
2. Disable or uninstall **Ariv Themes** from Extensions.
